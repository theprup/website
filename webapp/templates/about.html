            <p>
                I live in London and am currently on sabbatical as I try and figure out what I want to do next. I grew up in New Zealand and studied Law & English at Victoria University. From there I joined Uber in Melbourne
                where I was one of the early employees trying to scale UberX in an unregulated and sometimes hostile rideshare
                market. From there I joined <a href="https://www.spaceship.com.au">Spaceship</a> as employee ~6 where I helped grow the business to over 45,000 customers
                and $200m in AUM, when I left in 2019. Most recently I was a Product Manager at <a href="https://withplum.com">Plum</a> where I was responsible
                for the subscription products (Plum Pro & Plum Plus).

            <p class="notop">I gave a talk at Product School in London in 2019 on how to succeed in Product Management
             coming from a non-technical background:</p>
